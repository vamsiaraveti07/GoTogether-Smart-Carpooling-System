# GoTogether – Smart Carpooling System

A web-based smart carpooling application developed as part of the EXSEL academic project.
The system enables users to offer and book shared rides while tracking cost savings and emission reduction through ride sharing.

## Problem Statement
With rising traffic congestion, fuel wastage, and carbon emissions, the world is facing a serious environmental challenge. Idle vehicles contribute heavily to air pollution, and individual rides increase fuel consumption and costs. GoTogether provides an efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly alternative by connecting users for shared rides while promoting emission reduction strategies.

## 📊 How Emission Calculation Works (Example)

### Input

  Distance: 50 km
  
  Expected time: 60 minutes
  
  Actual time taken: 80 minutes

### Calculation

  Idle Time = 20 minutes
  
  Fuel Wasted = Idle Time × Fuel consumption rate
  
  Emissions = Fuel wasted × Emission factor

### Output

  Idle Time: 0.33 hours
  
  Fuel Wasted: ~0.5 liters
  
  CO₂ Emissions: ~1.15 kg
